## Topic
Actually this project was a competition for us. Our teacher creates a Kaggle competition in our class and we were working on it.
Our mission was to predict the price of a set of Diamonds!

## Technology stack ⚙

- Pyhton 
- Pandas 
- Numpy 
- sklearn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly

## Procedure

- First download the dataset from kaggle. 
- Read the dataset using our best friend Pandas.
- Clean and transform the data.
- Explore the dataset as much as possible(EDA).
- Divide the train dataset in X and y.
- Make train-test-split. In case of using GridSearchCV no need to do train-test-split.

## Next steps ➡️

Go testing different models of sklearn and make predictions.

## Folder structure 📁

- data 
- notebooks
- predictions
- README.md

## Output 📬

As my train dataset did not has target(in this case the price feature), I have tried to predict the best price for the diamonds of train dataset.
